 Question 1. Count Characters You are given a string S, and your task is to return an array 
 B (having a size of 2), where B[0] contains the count of character A (uppercase) in string S and 
 B[1] contains the count of character D (uppercase) in string S.
 Answer 1.
 const countCharacters = (S) => 
 {
      var B = [2];
   let countA = 0;
   let countD = 0;
   let i;
   for (i = 0; i < S.length; i++) {
     if (S[i] === "A") {
       countA += 1;
     } else if (S[i] === "D") {
       countD += 1;
     }
   }
   B[0] = countA;
   B[1] = countD;
   return B;
 };
 Quetion 2.Count the Heads
 Tina is given a string  S which contains the first letter of all the student names in her class.
  She got a curiosity to check how many people have their names starting from the same alphabet.
 So given a string  S , she decided to write a code that finds out the count of characters that occur more than once in the string.
 Answer 2.var Count_Occ = (s) => 
 {
  
       let Arr = s.split("").sort();
     var p;
     let map1 = new Map();
     for(let i =0; i<Arr.length;i++)
     {
       p=0;
      Arr.reduce((acc,val)=>
       {
         if(val == Arr[i])
         {
           p=acc+1;
         }
         return p;
       }, 0);
       map1.set(`${Arr[i]}` , p);
     }
     let z = [];
     map1.forEach((value,key)=>
     {
     if(value>1)
     {
       z.push(key + "" + value);
     }
     });
         return (z.join(""));  
 };
  Question 3.Count the Vowels
  You are given a string S
   containing both uppercase and lowercase letters. You need to find out the number of vowels in the given string. 
   Answer 3.var Count_Vowels= (S) => 
   {
   const count=S.match(/[aeiou]/gi).length;
   return count;
   };
 Question 4.Concatenate the Strings
 You are given two strings S1 and S2
  (containing both uppercase and lowercase letters), You need to retrun a string which is the concatenation of both the given strings. 
  Answer 4.var Concatenate_Strings = (S1, S2) => 
  {
      var result=S1.concat(S2);
      return result;
  };
  Question 5.Find Length
  You are given a string S, and your task is to return the length of the string S.
  Answer 5.const findLength = (S) => 
  {
     const result= S.length; 
     return result;
  };
  Question 6.Find the Winner
  You are given a string S consisting of two letters  A and D, where each character represent the winner of N games played between Aditya and Danish, where letter A represents the win of Aditya and letter D represents the win of Danish. 
  You need to find out the that which player wins the maximum number of games or there is a draw between them.
  Answer 6.var Game_Winner = (S) => 
  {
    let countA= S.match(/[A]/gmi).length;
    let countD= S.match(/[D]/gmi).length;
    if(countA > countD)
    {
      return 'Aditya';
    }
     else if(countA < countD)
    {
      return 'Danish';
    }
    else
    {
      return 'Draw';
    } 
  }
Quetion 7.Join Strings
You are given two strings S and P, and your task is to concatenate them and return the concatenated string. 
Answer 7.const joinStrings = (S, P) => 
{
var result=(S+P);
return result;
}
Question 8.Plaindrome Check
You are given a string S, Your task is to check wether the given string is a 
Palindrome  or not. A Palindrome
 is a string, which turnout same when read in reverse direction.
Example: "naman" is a Palindrome.
String can contain both upppercase lowercase letters.
Answer 8.var Palin_Check = (str) =>
{
	 
	let i=0;
	let j=str.length-1;
	while(i<=j)
    {
	  if(str[i]===str[j]){
	    i++;
	    j--;
	  }
	  else
	  {
	    return "False";
	    
	  }
	}
	return "True"
}
Question 9.Reverse the String
You are given a string S, Your task is to Reverse the string.
String can contain both upppercase lowercase letters. 
Answer 9. 
var Reverse_String = (str) => 
{
    var splitString = str.split("");
    var reverseArray = splitString.reverse(); 
     var joinArray = reverseArray.join("");
    return joinArray;
};
Question 10. Match the Strings
You are given two strings S1 and S2, Your task is to print 
YES  if both strings are same else print NO.
Answer 10.var String_Match = (S1,S2) => 
{
  let res=S1.localeCompare(S2);
  if(res===0)
  {
    return "YES";
     }
      else{
         return "NO";
      }
};
Question 11.String Replace
You are given a string S, along with a pattern string and a text string. 
You need to repalce the pattern string in S to the text string.
Answer 11.var Replace = (S, pattern , text) => 
{
   const str=S.replace(pattern,text);
   return str;
};
Question 12.Split the String
You are given a string S, Your task is to split the string with respect to spaces.
Answer 12.var Split_the_string = (S) => 
{
  const string1=S.split(" ");
  return string1;
  
};
Question 13. Count the Vowels and Consonants
You are given a string S containing both uppercase and lowercase letters. 
You need to find out the number of vowels and the number of consonants in the given string. 
Answer 13.var Count_Vowels= (S) => 
{
   const count = S.match(/[aeiou]/gi).length;
    return count;   
};
var Count_Consonants= (S) => 
{
    const count1 =S.split('').filter(e=>e.match(/[^aeiou]/)!==null).length;
    return count1;       
};
